    Hi there!
    My name is Tiffany Lee. Here's a little bit about me:
    
    I graduated in 2008 with a degree in Nuclear Science and Engineering
    I've always been interested in programming, having studied Java in college. In the past few years, I've been delving more into web programming through Harvard Extension School and I've been taking classes in Python, Javascript, and data science. I still consider myself a beginner though!
    
    My current hobby is gardening and my favorite place is my backyard among my veggie plants while they are in full bloom. This image is not my backyard, but I sure wish it were.
    
    Cafe Sushi in Harvard Square is one of the best sushi restaurants out there. I recommend getting the chef's special sushi lunch plate- expensive, but very special. Their saba (mackerel) is also particularly good.
